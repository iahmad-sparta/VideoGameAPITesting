## What was Tested?
In this project we found an number of testing areas (Epics) which we derived user stories from. The user Epics identified were:
### Authentication

ES-1
As a user, I want to be able to POST with a password and username  and get a status code 200 or 400 for invalid input.
 
### Api-video-games-controller
 
ES-2 
As a user, I would like to be able to GET a list of all the videogames on the website with the first controller
 
ES-3 
As a user, I would like to POST a video game
 
ES-4
As a user, I would like to GET a videogame based on id with the first controller
 
ES-5
As a user, I would like to PUT a video game with the first controller
 
ES-6
As a user, I would like to DELETE a video game with the first controller
 
### Api-video-games-controller-v-2
 
ES-7
As a user, I would like to be able to GET a list of all the videogames on the website with the second controller
 
ES-8 
As a user, I would like to POST a video game with the second controller
 
ES-9
As a user, I would like to GET a videogame based on id with the second controller
 
ES-10
As a user, I would like to PUT a video game with the second controller
 
 
ES-11
As a user, I would like to DELETE a video game with the second controller

The breakdown of these epics into user stories was done on the [project board](https://github.com/users/robert-h25/projects/2).
